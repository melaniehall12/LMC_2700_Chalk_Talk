# LMC_2700_Chalk_Talk

Project 5 "Chalk Talk" video game for LMC 2700 at Georgia Tech. 

"Chalk Talk" is a two-player drawing game created with Processing.js. When the game starts, Player 1 is given a theme and a certain amount of time to draw something based on that theme. When time is up, a new theme is given to Player 2 and they draw over Player 1's drawing to re-interpret it in their own theme. Once Player 2's time is up, the image and themes are displayed for both players.
